## 📝 Project Overview
- **Project Name:**
- **Purpose:** To manage tribal data effectively, integrating document processing, interactive map analysis, AI-assisted insights, and decision support tools.
- **Key Objectives:**  
  - Provide a secure platform for tribal welfare departments and NGOs.  
  - Enable document uploads, AI-driven text extraction, and verification.  
  - Offer interactive map layers with multiple filters and geocoding features.  
  - Deliver restricted decision support insights to authorized authorities.  
- **Target Users:**  
  - Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MOTA)  
  - District-level Tribal Welfare Departments & Line Departments of DAJGUA  
  - Forest and Revenue Departments  
  - Planning & Development Authorities  
  - NGOs working with tribal communities

## ⚙️ Features & Modules
- **Login / Signup / OTP Verification**  
  - User authentication with secure OTP and password reset.  
- **Upload & OCR**  
  - Upload FRA documents and extract text using OCR (Tesseract).  
  - Edit extracted text before saving to database.  
- **Interactive Map**  
  - Display multiple layers (scheme-based, land type, state-wise).  
  - Parcel hover displays owner and land details.  
  - Geocoding/Toponym Resolution converts addresses to coordinates.  
- **Decision Support** *(restricted access)*  
  - Advanced analysis and insights for Forest/Revenue and Planning Authorities.  
- **AI Assistance / Chatbot**  
  - AI-powered chatbot for queries on tribal data.  
- **Asset Mapping**  
  - Satellite imagery processed for land use and land cover classification using Transformer-based models.  
- **User Access Control**  
  - Feature access restricted based on user roles.
